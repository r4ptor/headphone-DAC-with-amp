# Portable headphone DAC with amplifier stage

A simple and portable audio digital to analogue converter with amplifying abilities.

## Structure

The Texas Instruments PCM2707 serves as the USB interface. This interface provides a clock and I2S signal for the main Hifi
digital to analogue converter, the PCM1794A.

Since this converter needs a 3.3V power source a LP5907 ultra-low-noise LDO is being used to
generate the desired voltage.

The DAC provides a differential output current. This is being feeded into a two opamps that are used as transimpedance amplifiers which convert the DAC output current into a differential voltage. Then a difference amplifier converts this differential voltage to single-ended. For this the TI reference design [TIDU672C](http://www.ti.com/litv/pdf/tidu672c) was used. Therefore the Amplifier stage consists as two OPA1612 and a OPA1622.

A LM2662M switched capacitor voltage converter generates the necessary -5V to supply the operational amplifiers with +-5V.

The project is realized with the open source EDA tool [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/).

With the current parts the whole project costs around 45â‚¬ at [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/). For details have a look at the [BOM.csv](https://github.com/r4ptor/headphone-DAC-with-amp/blob/master/BOM.csv) or [BOM.html](https://github.com/r4ptor/headphone-DAC-with-amp/blob/master/BOM.html).
