# Portable headphone DAC with amplifier stage

A simple and portable audio digital to analogue converter with amplifying abilities

## Structure

The Texas Instruments PCM2707 serves as the USB interface. This interface provides a clock and I2S signal for the main Hifi
digital to analogue converter, the PCM1794A.

Since this converter needs a 3.3V power source(and USB only provides 5V) a TPS60501DGS step-down charge pump is being used to
generate the desired V_DD voltage.

The Amplifier stage consists as two OPA2134PA. A LM2662M switched capacitor voltage converter generates the necessary -5V
to supply the operational amplifiers with +-5V.

The project is realized with the open source EDA tool [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/).

With the current parts the whole project costs around 45â‚¬ at [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/). For details have a look at the [BOM.csv](https://github.com/r4ptor/headphone-DAC-with-amp/blob/master/BOM.csv) or [BOM.html](https://github.com/r4ptor/headphone-DAC-with-amp/blob/master/BOM.html).
